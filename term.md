# Terminologies

Here are the definition of some common terms in programming languge:

### Domain-specific language
This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains.

Domain-specific languages are languages (or often, declared syntaxes or grammars) with very specific goals 
in design and implementation.

### [Domain-specific modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling)
Domain-specific modeling (DSM) is a software engineering methodology for designing and developing systems, 
such as computer software. 
It involves systematic use of a domain-specific language to represent the various facets of a system.

Domain-specific modeling languages tend to support higher-level abstractions than general-purpose modeling languages, 
so they require less effort and fewer low-level details to specify a given system.
